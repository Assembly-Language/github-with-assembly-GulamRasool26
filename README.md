remarks about sum-even

In this we first find Even Number Using Test Command
It do AND operation with least Significant-Bit 0001h
We use JNZ that jump if zero flag is zero and do sum operation in the same loop



remarks about sum-odd

We find ODD number using Test command 
Do And Operation with Least Significant bit 0001h
We use JZ means if zero flag is 1 so it will jump when positive number come

remarks about sum-pos
We find Positive Number First and do TEST Command
It will do AND operation with most significant bit 8000h
we use JNZ means if zero flag is 0 it will go to label and skip the add instructions


Overall remarks
the Tasks are based on concepts of Conditional jumps
Finding Positive,ODD,EVEN numbers using most-least significant bit
Use of Test Commmands
